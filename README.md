# LedVideoPlayer
This is the supervision software for the Subtronic Led Video System.
- Input stream is generated from mp4 video. Optional effects can be added using keyboard shortcuts (strobe, full color,...)
- Output feed is the pixel data output stream. UDP over Wifi is used to stream the buffer to LED modules.
